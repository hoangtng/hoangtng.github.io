<p>Computer Store Management is one of the Java projects in my ICS 211 course. This project helped me learn about the object-oriented programming features of Java. Additionally, I utilized exceptions to prevent the project from crashing when encountering logic errors.</p>

<p>The project is designed to encompass a wide range of functions necessary for managing computers in a computer store. These functions include adding storage computers to inventory, removing computers from storage, finding computers based on barcodes, and printing out all the computers in stock. All of these features are aimed at simplifying the work for the employees of the computer shop.</p>
