  <h3>The passion begins.</h3>
<p>My passion for computer science was sparked by my love for video games at an early age. As a person who enjoys tinkering with unknown things, I have dreamt of becoming a game developer since I was a child. As I grew older and became exposed to the proliferation of web applications, I became fascinated by the creativity and diversity of the cyber world. Consequently, I started dedicating myself to the serious study of computer science. 
During my freshman year of university, I took the initiative to learn about web app programming through YouTube. This self-guided learning journey immersed me deeper into the subject, and I found myself brimming with ideas and inspiration for various projects. I realized that I have the capability to accomplish a great deal in this field.</p>
<h3>Different focus</h3>
<p>To this day, my passion remains unwavering. During my years in university, I received training in programming languages such as C++, Java, and various other technologies and disciplines within computer science. The more I delved into the field, the more I discovered its vast and diverse world. While my initial aspiration was to become a video game developer, my learning journey unveiled the multitude of opportunities present in computer science.
While video game development still holds a special place in my heart, I now view it as just one of the many paths I can pursue in this dynamic field. The realm of computer science offers countless avenues to explore. I was particularly drawn to the new frontier of web development, as web applications intertwine with numerous areas of computer science and offer limitless possibilities. Additionally, my affinity for data led me to contemplate a career as either a backend engineer or data scientist.</p>
<h3>Future</h3>
<p>The remainder of my time as a computer science student has been a captivating journey, and I eagerly anticipate the adventures that lie ahead in the vast and ever-expanding horizons of the technology industry. As I reflect on the long road that awaits me, I am uncertain about what the future holds. However, my immediate goal upon graduation is to become a backend engineer. With the tech industry offering a rapidly growing array of opportunities, the possibilities seem boundless. I am determined to seize these opportunities and make the most of them.</p>
