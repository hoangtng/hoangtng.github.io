<p style="display: inline-block;
    margin-left: 40px;">Reflecting on my experience in ICS 414 this semester, I found it both challenging and rewarding. The course offered a comprehensive understanding of web development, enabling me to work with various programming languages and frameworks, including ReactJS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>

<p style="display: inline-block;
    margin-left: 40px;">One of the most significant aspects of the course was the opportunity to engage in a real-world project. My team and I developed a data visualization for Spire Hawaii. This project required extensive planning and collaboration, and we created a detailed project board to outline the features and milestones of our application. I was responsible for researching and implementing the import of customer data, such as Excel files, while also focusing on creating a user-friendly interface and ensuring the platform's functionality through rigorous testing and feedback sessions with our instructor.</p>

<p style="display: inline-block;
    margin-left: 40px;">Then, JavaScript is an object-oriented language that is prototype-based, that does not use classes to define objects. Instead, it uses prototypes, which are existing objects. In addition, JavaScript has the concept of “JavaScript treat function as a first-class”, this means that functions can be assigned to any other variable, passed as an argument, or returned by another function. </p>

<p style="display: inline-block;
    margin-left: 40px;">Throughout the semester, I faced various challenges, particularly in making the platform intuitive and accessible. This process involved refining the user experience based on feedback, which ultimately led to a more effective final product. The positive reception of our project from both my instructor and Spire Hawaii was incredibly gratifying and validated the hard work my team invested.</p>

<p style="display: inline-block;
    margin-left: 40px;">In addition to the technical skills I developed, I learned valuable lessons about teamwork and project management. Collaborating with my peers highlighted the importance of communication and adaptability, especially under tight deadlines. Presenting our work remotely due to the pandemic added another layer of complexity, but it also helped us enhance our presentation skills in a virtual environment.</p>

<p style="display: inline-block;
    margin-left: 40px;">Overall, ICS 414 has provided me with a strong foundation in web development and significantly improved my problem-solving abilities. I am grateful for the opportunity to work on such a meaningful project and am confident that the skills I gained will be invaluable as I pursue a career in software development.</p>
